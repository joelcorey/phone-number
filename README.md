in E.164 format. Return null (or an equivalent value) if the user input is invalid.

Use your preferred general purpose programming language.

Write a readme.txt file that describes the code's functionality and why you decided on your solution.

There is no time limit. Out of respect for your time, you can document the remainder of your solution if this problem 
takes more than 1 hour.

Document any online resources, third party libraries, and assumptions made when coding your solution.
